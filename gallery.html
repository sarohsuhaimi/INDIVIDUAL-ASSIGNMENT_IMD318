        <p>This is my group of high school friends, with whom I’ve shared countless memories since 2017. From the moment we met, our bond grew stronger as we navigated the ups and downs of school life together. We’ve supported each other through challenges, celebrated each other’s successes, and created a lifetime of inside jokes and shared experiences. Over the years, our friendship has only deepened, and despite the changes that come with time, we continue to stay connected. Each one of them brings something special to our group, whether it’s humor, wisdom, or unwavering loyalty. I’m grateful for having this friendship with them, and I know that no matter where life takes us, we will always be there for each other.</p>

        <p>This is my group of diploma friends, and we’ve known each other since semester 1. From the very beginning, we formed a strong bond that has only grown over the years. We’ve faced the challenges of assignments, exams, and projects together, supporting one another through both the highs and lows. As we approach our final semester, it’s clear that the memories and experiences we’ve shared will stay with us long after graduation. I’m grateful for the laughter, encouragement, and companionship they’ve given me throughout our time together.</p>
